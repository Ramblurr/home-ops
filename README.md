üëã Welcome to my Home Operations repository. This is a mono repository for my home office infrastructure. I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using the tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

Also check out [ramblurr/nixcfg](https://github.com/ramblurr/nixcfg) for my NixOS configuration for various hosts.

### :handshake: Thanks

Thanks to all the people who donate their time to the [Kubernetes @Home](https://discord.gg/k8s-at-home) Discord community. A lot of inspiration for my cluster comes from the people that have shared their clusters using the [k8s-at-home](https://github.com/topics/k8s-at-home) GitHub topic. Be sure to check out the [Kubernetes @Home search](https://nanne.dev/k8s-at-home-search/) for ideas on how to deploy applications or get ideas on what you can deploy.

And also a big thanks to the great community from the [Self-Hosted Podcast](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/self-hosted/) (and Jupiter Broadcasting in general!). It's a friendly community of FOSS, Linux, Self-Hosting advocates.
